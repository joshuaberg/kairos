# kairos
Simple webpage that displays travel time related info.  It displays the estimated commute time to work as well as the next three light rail times traveling north from my home stop.  It also displays the current temperature and weather conditions.  

Run it on a raspberry pi connected to a spare monitor to always have the information available at a glance.  See below for how i implimented it on top of my cabinets in Charlotte.
